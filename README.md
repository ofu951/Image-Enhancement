Welcome the repo!

Here you can find my deep learning models. You can download and try these models. I also added one python script for testing the results. Do not forget it is still improving.
Just follow these steps,
1) Download all of files or just pick one of model and download with python script.
2) Check your image path is correct!
3) Run the script (Need to download tensorflow and sometimes it requires virtual environment. Just create a virtual environment and activate it "source bin/activate" and download tensorflow and run this script again!)
4) Enjoy your results!
5) You can change the pictures even you can integrated a video. If you have more videos or pictures for underwater just let me know and dont hasitate to share with me!
